# CordovaAssessmentTest
An Apache Cordova project I created for an assessment test during a job application process

# Description
This project is a short 3-day project made in Apache Cordova for an assessment test for a job application
I studied how to install and use Cordova from scratch, and accomplished a simple list view of data extracted from a URL
The project has web components as well, but the Android platform version is the main focus of the test so that is what I uploaded
